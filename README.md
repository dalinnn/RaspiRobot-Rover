#RaspiRobot-Rover

This is a python program developed from Simon Monk's '08_manual_robot.py' program which is included in the Rover Kit. By using multiprocessing it is possible to enable the sensor to be operational at the same time as the robot is being controlled by keystrokes.

Further work will to be done on this program. For one thing the program will only exit after CTRL-c is pressed twice. (Presumably because the Process loop is running at the same time?)
